Well, professor Eileen's lecture was interesting, but to be honest, I couldn't concentrate on it very much.
I had a lot of other thoughts on my mind, and they all ended up with a question.
A question I've been meaning to ask someone.
When we came out of the university, I saw her.
She was a wonderful person. I've known her ever since we were children, and she's always been a good friend.
But... Recently... I think...
... that I wanted more.
More just talking... more than just walking home together when our classes ended.
Oh, hi, do we walk home together?
Yes...
I said and my voice was already shaking.
We reached the meadows just outside our hometown. Autumn was so beautiful here.
When we were children, we often played here.
Hey... ummm...
She turned to me and smiled.
I'll ask her...
Ummm... will you...
Will you be my artist for a visual novel?
Silence.
She is shocked. And then...
Sure, but what is a "visual novel?"
It's a story with pictures and music. And you'll be able to make choices that influence the outcome of the story.
So it's like those choose-your-adventure books?
Exactly! I plan on making a small romantic story. I figured you could help me... since I know how you like to draw.
Well, I can try. I hope I don't disappoint you.
You can't disappoint me, you know that.
Why it's a game with lots of sex.
You mean, like a boy's love game? I've always wanted to make one of those. I'll get right on it!
...
That wasn't what I meant!
--- years later ---
And so, we became a visual novel creating team. We made games and had a lot of fun making them.
Well, apart from that Boy's Love game she insisted on making.
And one day, she asked me...
Hey...
Yes?
Marry me!
What???
Well, don't you love me?
I do, actually.
See? We've been making romantic visual novels, spending time together, helping each other... and when you give love to others, love will come to you.
Hmmm, that's a nice thought.
I just made that up.
But it's good.
I know. So, will you marry me?
Ummm, of course I will. I've actually been meaning to ask you, but since you brought it up...
I know, but you are so indecisive, that I thought I'd take the initiative. 
I guess... It's all about asking the right question... at the right time.
It is. But now, stop being theoretical, and give me a kiss!
And we got married shortly after that. In fact, we made many more visual novels. And together, we lived happily ever after.
.:. Good Ending.
And so I decided to ask her later.
But I was indecisive.
I couldn't ask her that day, and I couldn't ask her later. I guess I will never know now.
.:. Bad Ending.
